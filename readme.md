#### x86_64 asm experiments in rust

[uncle terry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis) approached me in a dream and told me i need to write my own damn compiler.

anyway the idea is to skip the LLVM and GCC goliaths and output raw asm (or nasm) instead and `[no_std]` rust is a good reference to what some common functions look like in asm
